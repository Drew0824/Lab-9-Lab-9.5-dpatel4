# Water Bill
Write a program that prompts the user for their quarterly water bill for the last four quarters. The program should find and output their average monthly water bill. 

If the average monthly bill exceeds $75, the output should include a message indicating that too much water is being used. If the average bill is at least $25 but no more than $75, the output should indicate that a typical amount of water is being used. Finally, if the average bill is less than $25, the output should contain a message praising the user for conserving water. 

Use the sample run below as a model for your output. Make sure the output from your program matches the Sample Runs.
